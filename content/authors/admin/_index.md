Hi! I am Sukannya Purkayastha (/suːˈkɑːn.jə/), a final year PhD student at <a href="https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/index.en.jsp">Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing Lab, TU Darmstadt, Germany</a> supervised by <a href="https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/head_ukp/index.en.jsp">Prof. Dr Iryna Gurevych</a> and <a href="https://anne-lauscher.de/">Prof. Dr. Anne Lauscher</a>. I am currently working as a Research Intern at <a href ="https://neclab.eu/">NEC Labs, Germany</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://neclab.eu/research-groups/human-centric-ai/people/people-detail/dr-rernat-shahbaz-syed">Dr. Shahbaz Syed</a> and <a href="https://neclab.eu/research-groups/human-centric-ai/people/people-detail/dr-carolin-lawrence">Dr. Carolin Lawrence</a>. Prior to that, I earned my MS(Research) in Natural Language Processing from the Department of Computer Science, <a href="https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/">IIT Kharagpur</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~sudeshna/">Prof. Sudeshna Sarkar</a> and <a href="https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~pawang/">Prof. Pawan Goyal</a>. 

My research lies at the intersection of natural language processing and machine learning, focusing on human-centered, culturally aware, and efficient NLP systems. Currently, my work focusses on scholarly communication and reasoning, particularly in the domain of peer reviews. I have also explored multilingual and multimodal understanding, parameter-efficient transfer learning, optimization techniques, and applications in conversational systems and knowledge graphs. If you are interested in collaborating, feel free to reach out to me!

In my free time, I love cooking and learning random new facts (not a quizzer but love quizzes!).
